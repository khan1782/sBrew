It is also smoother than keg beer because it is dispensed without the use of carbon dioxide (CO2). Draught beer is pushed from a keg using CO2, while cask beer is pulled out of the cask and drawn into the glass using a siphon pump device called a beer engine. This is the traditional serving technique found in pubs in the UK.<br></p><p>We tap a new cask every Thursday at 5 p.m.</p><p><strong><em>Tapping this week:</em></strong></p><p><strong><em></em></strong></p><p><strong><em></em></strong></p><p><strong><em></em></strong></p><p><strong><em></em></strong></p><strong><em>Whole Leaf Cascade-Hopped Columbia Street Amber Ale</em></strong><strong><em><br></em></strong><p><strong><em>4.5% ABV - 15 SRM - 18 IBU\u00a0</em></strong><br></p><p><strong><em></em></strong></p><p><strong><em></em></strong></p><p><strong><em></em></strong></p><p><strong><em></em></strong></p><p><strong><em></em></strong></p><p><strong><em></em></strong></p><p><strong><em></em></strong></p><p><strong><em></em></strong></p><p><strong><em></em></strong></p><p><strong><em></em></strong></p><p><strong><em></em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Our\noriginal session beer cask-conditioned with whole leaf Cascade hops.

SWING IN AND JOIN US!!! THE PUB CRAWL BETWEEN PAW, HALF DOOR AND RESIDENT IS STILL THE SAME AS SCHEDULED.***</p><p>Downtown Brewpubs Monkey Paw, Resident &amp; Half Door Brewing are teaming together to make \u201c11 Barrel IPA\u201d. This solidarity brew was founded on principles in opposition against big beer and their obfuscation in pursuit of outcomes that negatively impact both the local San Diego small beer industry and all the members of the Brewers Association defined as \"small and independent American craft brewers\".</p><p>When a large brewer has a controlling share of a smaller producing brewery, the brewer is, by definition, not craft. We have seen many of our larger and more influential brewing companies and small brewer organizations seemingly become more complicit with the upward battle against these multinational juggernauts. We have witnessed collusion with local media, urban planners, and real estate developers and this in itself shows the sheer power and influence these big beer companies have. Insidious statements from these large, multinational brewers such as \"the pub localize the brand\u201d show just how manipulative their tactics are in hopes to regain a stranglehold on our beer industry.</p><p>When \"crafty\" large brewers espouse propaganda that deliberately blurs the lines between small, local and independent beer it is exactly this lack of transparency that doesn\u2019t allow beer drinkers to make an informed choice about who brews and benefits from the beer they are drinking. So this is why it is so imperative we ban together and do a far better job at shining a big bright light on the truth because it\u2019s our industry and our communities who will suffer in the long run when all of our choices become limited as our peers and their small brands are shoved to the back of the box stores while the big beer \u201csock puppets\u201d move to the forefront.</p><p>So 11 Barrel IPA is just one way in which we can try and show solidarity and a common voice in opposition against these ill-intended usurpers. With a much louder unified voice by standing up against the behemoth that stands in direct opposition to our small beer values. Perhaps this can reenergize and motivate small brewers to continue to bang the drum and bring awareness to this potential industry epidemic.</p><p>That being said the 11 Barrel IPA series will be a 7% IPA with 60% of the total hop bill deriving from one specific hop. From that point, each brewery will craft the rest of the recipe (water, yeast, adjunct, grain) to their unique styles and vision which are the hallmarks of small indie beer making. We plan to release these 11 Barrel IPA's on May 28th with a solidarity brewpub crawl with portions of the proceeds going to causes that will support the serious homeless crisis we are having in our community.</p><p>10 Barrel\u2019s Garret Wales has been very pointed that \u201c(The critics) are a very small but vocal minority\u201d and that is a statement that is hard to accept as real news. So this inaugural batch will kick off May 10th and we are inviting all of our friends and industry members as well as fans of small beer to come down to any of our breweries to take part with us in this solidarity brew. Our doors are wide open for you to come partake with us and we all would love to have you!</p><p>Details: 11 Barrel IPA \u2013 Batch 1</p><p>Style: American IPA - 7%<br>Hops: 60% Hop - Idaho 7<br>Brew Date: 8 am -Mash In -Wednesday, May 10th, 2017<br>Pub Crawl and Official Release: Sunday, May 28th: 2 pm- 6 pm \u2013 (Bus, Walk, Bike, Run)<br>Charity Contribution: Portions of the proceeds of each pint sold at our brewpubs will go to Downtown San Diego Homeless and Hunger causes.</p><p>PLEASE JOIN US!</p><p>Resident Brewing -robert@residentbrewing.com<br>1065 Fourth Ave, San Diego, CA 92101</p><p>Monkey Paw Brewing \u2013 sblair@hamiltonstavern.com -nick@monkeypawbrewing.com,<br>807 16th St, San Diego, CA 92104</p><p>Half Door Brewing - halfdoorbrewer@gmail.com<br>903 Island Ave, San Diego, CA 92101<br><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/halfdoorbrewing?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=1315523381873131\">#halfdoorbrewing</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/residentbrewing?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=1315523381873131\">#residentbrewing</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/sdbg?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=1315523381873131\">#SDBG</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/brewersassociation?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=1315523381873131\">#brewersassociation</a><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/californiacraftbeer?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=1315523381873131\">#californiacraftbeer</a></p>"}, {"tag1": "Beer Releases", "external_event_url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1800956553491102/", "title": "Beer Release: Valle Pura Vida", "updated": "2017-05-02 08:37:10.832547-07:00", "location_uuid": "iD56Zs412yai", "created": "2017-05-02 08:37:10.831629-07:00", "end_date": "2017-05-04 14:00:00-07:00", "event_photos": [{"height": 640, "width": 1280, "mimetype": "image/png", "url": "https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/euukPByiSSA6oOPoVi2A"}], "kind": "event", "visible": true, "start_date": "2017-05-04 05:00:00-07:00", "id": 49807, "body": "<p>One of our Costa Rican Inspired recipes is back!

It is also smoother than keg beer because it is dispensed without the use of carbon dioxide (CO2).
